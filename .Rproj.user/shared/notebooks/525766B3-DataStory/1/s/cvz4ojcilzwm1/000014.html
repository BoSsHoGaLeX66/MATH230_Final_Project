<p>Formula One is a cut throat sport where every millisecond counts. The difference of one second
  can mean the difference between starting on the front of the grid and dead last. However there are some 
  drivers who can rise above the rest and find every last millisecond and get every last drop of performance
  out of the car no matter what. This is what makes a world champion in formula one. Then there are drivers who
  can do this year after year and this is what makes a driver a legend. In this article we are going to explore
  the stats that seperate regular drivers from world champions, and champions from legends. We are considering legends
  to be F1 drivers who have won 4 or more world championships in their careers. These are Michael Schumacher,
  Lewis Hamilton, Juan Manuel Fangio, Alain Prost, Max Verstappen. We will also be including Aryton Senna,
  Although he does not have 4 world champion ship wins he is still one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time and would
  have likely had many more wins if his life was not cut short in his tragic crash of 1994 at Imola.</p>
