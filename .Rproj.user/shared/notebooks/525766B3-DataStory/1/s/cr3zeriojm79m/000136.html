<p>As you can see in the graph above Max Verstappen is in purple and you can see that he
  already gained back positions on the first lap and then went on to storm through the field to 
  secure 2nd place starting from 15th. This is a mark of a legend even when they are put in tough situations
  they can find that extra gear within themselves to charge through the field and get back on the podium. Max later 
  went on to win the championship that year and this is one of the reasons why.</p>
