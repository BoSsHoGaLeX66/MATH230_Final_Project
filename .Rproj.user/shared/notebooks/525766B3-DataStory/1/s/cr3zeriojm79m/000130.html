<p>The all time greats can always fight back looking at the All time Greats graph you can see that they can always gain
  back positions even when they start a little farther back. This also shows us that they rarely ever start outside
  the top 6 and finish with in the top 5 a majority of the time while regular champs are a lot more inconsistent. From looking at 
  the graph of the regular champs we can see that when the start on the back foot sometimes they struggle to comeback and they
  also don't consistently start and finish within the top 5 drivers. We also see that Champions are a lot less likely to start and finish
  on the top of the grid versus legends who from looking at the density graph have a much higher probablility of starting and finishing 
  at the front of the grid. Also from looking at the champions and the legendary drivers
  we can see that they are much better than normal drivers. Normal drivers are all over the place and there are higher likely hoods
  that when they start higher up on the grid that they fall back. And this is what sets the champions and the legends apart from the
  regular drivers, that the rarely lose positions in a race.</p>
