<p>To become a F1 world champion you need to win a lot of the races in the season to secure the championship title.
  champions will have high win rates but some years will be lower than others when the title is highly contested and 
  nobody has run away with it. However when legends win titles they do it dominately winning a vast amount of races in the season.</p>
