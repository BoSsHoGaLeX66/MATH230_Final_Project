<p>As you can see in the chart above the all time greats have extremely high win rates
  through out their careers. Their win rates are also higher than most of the other champions
  with a few exceptions. This shows that these drivers were not only great when they won
  championships but that the still won races even in years where they didn,t clinch the title.</p>
