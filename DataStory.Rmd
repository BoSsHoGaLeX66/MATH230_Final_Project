p("Formula One is a cut throat sport where every millisecond counts. The difference of one second
  can mean the difference between starting on the front of the grid and dead last. However there are some 
  drivers who can rise above the rest and find every last millisecond and get every last drop of performance
  out of the car no matter what. This is what makes a world champion in formula one. Then there are drivers who
  can do this year after year and this is what makes a driver a legend. In this article we are going to explore
  the stats that seperate regular drivers from world champions, and champions from legends. We are considering legends
  to be F1 drivers who have won 4 or more world championships in their careers. These are Michael Schumacher,
  Lewis Hamilton, Juan Manuel Fangio, Alain Prost, Max Verstappen. We will also be including Aryton Senna,
  Although he does not have 4 world champion ship wins he is still one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time and would
  have likely had many more wins if his life was not cut short in his tragic crash of 1994 at Imola. All of these drivers
  were at the top of the sport for years making them almost super human.")

  the graph of the regular champs we can see that when the start on the back foot sometimes they struggle to comeback and they
  also don't consistently start and finish within the top 5 drivers. We also see that Champions are a lot less likely to start and finish
  on the top of the grid versus legends who from looking at the density graph have a much higher probablility of starting and finishing 
  at the front of the grid. Also from looking at the champions and the legendary drivers
  we can see that they are much better than normal drivers. Normal drivers are all over the place and there are higher likely hoods
  that when they start higher up on the grid that they fall back. And this is what sets the champions and the legends apart from the
  regular drivers, that the rarely lose positions in a race.")

  they can find that extra gear within themselves to charge through the field and get back on the podium. Max later

p("Becoming a F1 world champion is no easy task in the people who are able are some of the greatest drivers 
  to every walk this planet. But even among these champions there are still some who rise above the rest. 
  These legends win multiple championships, come back from adversity, and always finish at the top of the grid.
  Through looking at historical F1 data today we saw some of this. The win rates of Legends we higher than most other
  drivers who one world championships showing that these drivers were dominate during their tenures in F1. We also saw
  that when they won championships that did so with conviction winning a majority of the races for that season. We also
  saw that these legends have a higher chance of starting and finishing on the top of the grid even when compared to other 
  champions and an even greater chance than a regular driver. This is what sets them a part from the rest they win a lot
  and are extremely consitent even when things don't go their way like when Max Verstappen fought back from 15th to finish 2nd.
  The drivers that remain at the top of this sport for years are truely super human.")
